## Overview

This repository contains the code and methodologies used for the comparative evaluation of the wear behavior of epoxy matrix hybrid nano-composites. The study employs various machine learning models, including Deep Multi-Layer Perceptron, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, Linear Regression, and Polynomial Regression, to predict wear loss accurately. The performance of these models is evaluated using metrics such as R², MAE, MSE, RMSE, and MAPE, aiming to optimize time and cost in tribological assessments.

## Study Summary

This study aims to evaluate the wear behavior of multiwall carbon nanotube (MWCNT) doped non-crip fabric-carbon fiber reinforced polymer (NCF-CFRP) hybrid composites produced through vacuum infusion experiments and to model these experiments using Machine Learning (ML) techniques. Predicting wear behavior is crucial for understanding and optimizing complex tribological mechanisms. Due to the lengthy and costly nature of tribological testing, ML approaches are vital for predicting wear behavior and identifying system anomalies in advance.

The study found that, despite some homogeneity issues, the amount of MWCNT, wear weight, and volume losses exhibited linear changes. Observations included partially plastered molten surfaces and deformation effects on worn surfaces, which increased with wear load and distance. Various ML methods, including Deep Multi-Layer Perceptron, Random Forest Regression, Gradient Boosting, Linear Regression, and Polynomial Regression, were utilized to predict wear loss. All models achieved performance values above 92%, with the highest results from Linear Regression and Deep Multi-Layer Perceptron exceeding 99%. These models optimize the time and cost required for experimental studies while providing highly accurate predictions of wear characteristics, offering a new perspective on the tribological characterization of MWCNT-doped NCF-CFRP composites.
