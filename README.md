# ML_Wear_Loss_Prediction_Composite_Materials
Comparative evaluation of wear behavior in epoxy matrix hybrid nano-composites through experimental and machine learning models, focusing on Deep Multi-Layer Perceptron, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, Linear, and Polynomial Regression with high accuracy metrics (RÂ², MAE, MSE, RMSE, MAPE) to optimize time and cost in tribological assessments.
